inputs:
  primary-key:
    description: |
      - When a non-empty string, the action uses this key for restoring and saving a cache.
      - Otherwise, the action fails.
    required: true
  
  restore-prefixes-first-match:
    description: |
      - When a newline-separated non-empty list of non-empty key prefixes, when there's a miss on the `primary-key`, 
        the action searches in this list for the first prefix for which there exists a cache 
        with a matching key and the action tries to restore that cache.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: ""
  restore-prefixes-all-matches:
    description: |
      - When a newline-separated non-empty list of non-empty key prefixes, the action tries to restore 
        all caches whose keys match these prefixes.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: ""

  skip-restore-on-hit-primary-key:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `restore-prefixes-first-match` has no effect.
      - When `true`, when there's a hit on the `primary-key`, the action doesn't restore caches.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.
    default: "false"

  fail-on:
    description: |
      - Input form: `<key type>.<result>`.
      - `<key type>` options: `primary-key`, `first-match`.
      - `<result>` options: `miss`, `not-restored`.
      - When the input satisfies the input form, when the event described in the input happens, the action fails.
        - Example:
          - Input: `primary-key.not-restored`.
          - Event: a cache could not be restored via the `primary-key`.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.

  paths:
    description: |
      - When `nix: true`, uses `["/nix", "~/.cache/nix", "~root/.cache/nix"]` as default paths. Otherwise, uses an empty list as default paths.
      - When a newline-separated non-empty list of non-empty path patterns (see [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) for supported patterns), the action appends it to default paths and uses the resulting list for restoring and saving caches.
      - Otherwise, the action uses default paths for restoring and saving caches.

  gc-max-store-size:
    description: |
      - Can have an effect only when `nix: true`, `save: true`.
      - When a number, the action collects garbage until Nix store size (in bytes) is at most this number just before the action tries to save a new cache.
      - Otherwise, this input has no effect.

    # The original default value may be provided here (https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/1292)
